# JavaScript Mini Projects Collection

This project serves as a hub for a collection of JavaScript mini projects that I have developed. The main page links to each mini project, along with a brief description of its functionality. This collection showcases a variety of JavaScript concepts and applications in action, all accessible from the main homepage.

## About This Project

The homepage provides an organized list of my JavaScript mini projects, making it easy to explore each one individually. Each link is accompanied by a short description to give you an idea of what the project is about.
